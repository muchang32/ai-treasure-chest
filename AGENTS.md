## Product Builder Engineering Rules — Core

Version: 1.1

> Single source of truth for always-on engineering rules.
> Read by VS Code (GitHub Copilot) directly, and by Claude Code via `@AGENTS.md` in CLAUDE.md.
> Stack-specific rules live in path-scoped files (see end of this document).

## Mission

Build products that solve real user problems.

Priorities:

1. Correctness
2. User Experience
3. Maintainability
4. Security
5. Performance
6. Development Speed

Never optimize for clever code. Optimize for shipping valuable products.

---

## How to read these rules

Every rule has an ID and a severity:

```
MUST   Non-negotiable. Violating it is a defect. Block or fix.
SHOULD Strongly recommended. To break it, state why in the PR or a comment.
MAY    Use when it fits.
```

When rules conflict, resolve by the Mission priority order:

```
Correctness > UX > Maintainability > Security > Performance > Speed
```

Reference rules by ID in reviews and commits, e.g. "violates DEV-02".

---

## PRODUCT FIRST

**PB-01 · MUST** — Before implementing, state `User / Problem / Value`. If value can't be explained clearly, stop and ask.

**PB-02 · SHOULD** — Avoid feature bloat. Ask "can users reach their goal without this?" If yes, backlog it.

**PB-03 · SHOULD** — Prefer MVP (simple, understandable, deployable) before scalable/extensible/enterprise-grade, unless explicitly required.

---

## REQUIREMENT ANALYSIS

**REQ-01 · MUST** — Before coding, provide **Understanding** (what), **Plan** (how), **Risks** (unknowns/assumptions).

**REQ-02 · MUST** — Never invent requirements. When unclear, ask. Do not guess.

**REQ-03 · MUST** — Define acceptance criteria before building.

**REQ-04 · MUST** — Capture non-functional requirements early: scale, performance, security/privacy, availability, compatibility. These decide the architecture.

---

## SYSTEM DESIGN

**ARCH-01 · SHOULD** — Feature-first folders (`app/ components/ features/ lib/ services/ hooks/ types/`). Avoid giant folders.

**ARCH-02 · MUST** — Business logic never lives in UI. Flow: `UI → Service → Repository → Database`.

**ARCH-03 · SHOULD** — Keep files focused: components < 300, hooks < 200, services < 300 lines. Split large files.

**ARCH-04 · MUST** — TypeScript types are contracts. Avoid `any`; prefer `type` / `interface` / zod schema.

**ARCH-05 · SHOULD** — For hard-to-reverse decisions (DB, core framework, auth model), write a short ADR: `Context → Options → Decision → Why`.

---

## SECURITY

**SEC-01 · MUST** — Secrets in env vars only. Never commit them, expose them to the client bundle, or log them. Separate config per env (dev/staging/prod).

**SEC-02 · MUST** — Authenticate AND authorize on the server for every protected route, Server Action, and API. Client-side checks are UX, not security.

**SEC-03 · MUST** — Least privilege everywhere. The service-role key never reaches the client.

**SEC-04 · MUST** — Do not invent your own crypto or auth. Use vetted platform auth and standard libraries.

**SEC-05 · MUST** — Prevent injection and unsafe output: parameterized queries/ORM (never string concat), escape output (XSS), validate redirects.

**SEC-06 · SHOULD** — Rate-limit public, expensive, abusable endpoints (auth, uploads, AI generation).

**SEC-07 · SHOULD** — Keep dependencies healthy: pin versions, audit, patch known CVEs.

**SEC-08 · SHOULD** — Protect sessions/forms: HttpOnly+Secure cookies, CSRF protection, sensible security headers.

---

## AI OUTPUT SAFETY

**AI-01 · MUST** — AI output is always untrusted. Validate format, structure, and content before use.

**AI-02 · MUST** — AI failures must be recoverable. Never allow blank screens, unhandled responses, or silent failures.

**AI-03 · SHOULD** — Show progress feedback (Thinking… / Generating… / Analyzing…) for slow operations.

---

## CODING

**DEV-01 · MUST** — Names are documentation. Avoid `data/tmp/item/value`; prefer `invoiceRows`, `patientRecords`, `billingSummary`.

**DEV-02 · SHOULD** — Prefer early return; reduce nesting.

**DEV-03 · SHOULD** — Delete dead code. Git stores history.

**DEV-04 · SHOULD** — Comments explain WHY, not WHAT.

**DEV-05 · SHOULD** — Don't over-abstract. Rule of Three: 1st duplicate → 2nd observe → 3rd extract.

---

## ERROR HANDLING

**ERR-01 · MUST** — Never swallow errors. Handle, wrap-and-rethrow, or log — never an empty catch.

**ERR-02 · MUST** — Validate all external input: forms, CSV, APIs, query params, env vars.

**ERR-03 · MUST** — User-facing errors are understandable and actionable. Never leak stack traces or sensitive detail.

---

## OBSERVABILITY & LOGGING

**OBS-01 · MUST** — Log key flows with structure and context (request id, user id where safe). Never log secrets or PII.

**OBS-02 · SHOULD** — Send errors to monitoring with enough context to diagnose without a repro.

**OBS-03 · SHOULD** — Metrics and alerts on critical paths. Learn about outages before users report them.

**OBS-04 · MAY** — Trace slow/costly operations (AI calls, heavy DB queries).

---

## TESTING

**TEST-01 · MUST** — Test behavior, not implementation details.

**TEST-02 · MUST** — For every feature verify: Success, Failure, Empty, Edge Case.

**TEST-03 · MUST** — Bug fix workflow: Reproduce → Write test → Fix → Verify.

**TEST-04 · SHOULD** — Follow the test pyramid: many unit, some integration, few e2e.

**TEST-05 · SHOULD** — CI must pass before merge (tests + linter + type check + format). A red build does not merge.

---

## GIT

**GIT-01 · MUST** — One commit = one logical change.

**GIT-02 · SHOULD** — Separate feature / refactor / fix when possible.

**GIT-03 · MUST** — Commit messages explain why.

---

**GIT-04 · MUST** — Before the first commit, create a `.gitignore` that covers: `.env*`, `node_modules/`, build output (`.next/` etc.), and any credential files (`*.pem`). Never commit secrets even accidentally.

---

## DEPLOYMENT

**SHIP-01 · MUST** — Code review before merging to main. Review design, readability, security, tests — not just "does it run".

**SHIP-02 · MUST** — `main` is always deployable. Develop on branches, merge via PR.

**SHIP-03 · SHOULD** — Ship through staging before prod. Have a tested rollback path.

**SHIP-04 · SHOULD** — Keep environments separated and reproducible (dev/staging/prod).

**SHIP-05 · MAY** — Track tech debt explicitly as backlog items.

---

## SELF REVIEW

Before finishing, ask:

```
Does it work?            (Correctness)
Is it understandable?    (Maintainability)
Is it secure?            (authN/authZ, secrets, input)
Is it accessible?        (keyboard, semantics, contrast)
Are all states handled?  (Loading / Empty / Error / Success)
Is it necessary?         (Product value)
```

If any answer is no, improve it.

---

## REQUIRED RESPONSE FORMAT

For all implementation tasks:

```
Understanding · Plan · Implementation · Risks · Validation · Next Steps
```

---

## FINAL RULE

Do not write code immediately.

```
Understand first. Plan second. Build third. Review fourth. Ship last.
```

---
